# MediaPipe Projects Collection

Welcome to my collection of my projects using [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/)!

## Current Projects

### Hand Tracking Cursor Control
The **Hand Tracking Cursor Control** script uses `MediaPipe`, `OpenCV`, and `PyAutoGUI` to control the mouse cursor with hand gestures. When the thumb and index finger pinch together, the code simulates a mouse click.

#### Features:
- Tracks hand movement in real-time.
- Moves the cursor according to hand position on the screen.
- Simulates a mouse click when thumb and index fingers are pinched.

> **Note:** In future updates, I'll add more functionalities and scripts for different poses, face detection, and object tracking.
